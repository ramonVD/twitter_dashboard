### Small dashboard to check tweets
Unfinished. So far only searching for tweets using text queries works, plus authentication (set to a mysql db by default)

You'll need to supply your own twitter bearer token (from the twitter dev page) and it's good to go. Has a bunch of mock tweets for testing but it can use the API.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
